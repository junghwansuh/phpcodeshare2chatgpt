<condition 1>. We have a blind unit price (k: 15,000 won) per 1„é° of unit area.

<condition 2.> We will receive 'width: val1' and 'height: val2' separately from the customer and obtain the total selling price (P).

<condition 3>. In other words, if customer enters 'width: val1' and 'height: val2' at once, we can easily obtain 'the area (A)' by multiplying the blind unit price per unit area in <condition1>. However, we need a way to solve the problem because customer cannot escape the conditions in <condition 2>.
